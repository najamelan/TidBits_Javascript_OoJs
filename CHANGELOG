13.12.27-beta
-------------

TODO: test adding multiple friend classes, possibly validation on friend classes, a few features still need tests to be written for them

change 1, 2 BREAK COMPATIBILITY WITH PRIOR VERSIONS

1. Changing the access level of inherited members now needs to be done as: this/Static.Private( "Base.method", "Base.datamember" )
   This assures compatibility with C++ because it allows you to have members in subclasses with the same name as members in base classes.

2. Access level on class level for inheritance. Now defaults to private as in C++. To inherit public/protected pass { inherit: "Baseclass", as: "public" } to setupClass instead of just your baseclass name.

3. Static.Friends() now allows friend classes

4. Rewrite of the unit tests, now runs about 1600 tests

5. You can now safely seal your public interface before returning it from your constructor

6. Access to all inherited classes is now available on both private and public objects as myObject.BaseClass.member

7. Cache bound methods instead of calling bind on every access
